  abstract = {Spaced repetition is among the most studied learning strategies in the cognitive science literature. It consists in temporally distributing exposure to an information so as to improve long-term memorization. Providing students with an adaptive and personalized distributed practice schedule would benefit more than just a generic scheduler. However, the applicability of such adaptive schedulers seems to be limited to pure memorization, e.g. flashcards or foreign language learning. In this article, we first frame the research problem of optimizing an adaptive and personalized spaced repetition scheduler when memorization concerns the application of underlying multiple skills. To this end, we choose to rely on a student model for inferring knowledge state and memory dynamics on any skill or combination of skills. We argue that no knowledge tracing model takes both memory decay and multiple skill tagging into account for predicting student performance. As a consequence, we propose a new student learning and forgetting model suited to our research problem: DAS3H builds on the additive factor models and includes a representation of the temporal distribution of past practice on the skills involved by an item. In particular, DAS3H allows the learning and forgetting curves to differ from one skill to another. Finally, we provide empirical evidence on three real-world educational datasets that DAS3H outperforms other state-of-the-art EDM models. These results suggest that incorporating both item-skill relationships and forgetting effect improves over student models that consider one or the other.},

Our approach is supported by the proposition of a set of generic transformations to apply to the original agent program that is expressed in IndiGolog, a variant of the Golog language. Several of these transformations exploit the non-determinism present in IndiGolog programs. We also propose an automatic process to apply all those transformations on the basis of a set of parameters. Three case-studies show the significance of the approach in situations where agents are in interaction with human users.},

  abstract = {Geological cross-sections are convenient supports for synthesizing geological knowledge of given geological subsurface structures. They contain information about the geological time of the formations and their architecture. Querying a database of case study reports or papers with geological cross-sections could be then a convenient way to find geological analogues. Image-content query is used to achieve this kind of query. It is often performed using deep-learning, but these techniques require numerous pairs of original images and associated human-tagged images in order to obtain satisfying results after the training phase. Alternative approaches rely on image similarity measures based on textures, colours or shapes contained in the images. In this paper, we propose such a method for ranking geological cross-sections using two kinds of similarity measures: (i) the presence and proportion of formations from similar geological times; (ii) the global geological architecture. This approach combines the use of a colour dictionary and different correlation measures. Noddy is a software allowing synthetic geological cross-sections to be generated using a series of geological events (faulting, tilting, folding, etc.). A database of 100,000 geological cross-sections was generated using Noddy. In each cross-section, the layers are colored following the standard ICS color codes. Results of cross-section rankings are shown from this database and discussed.},

Computing the best OERs to offer to the learner at each point of his course is an aspect of personalization that we address in this paper.

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new method of representation learning that aims to embed documents in a stylometric space. Previous studies in the field of authorship analysis focused on feature engineering techniques in order to represent document styles and to enhance model performance in specific tasks. Instead, we directly embed documents in a stylometric space by relying on a reference set of authors and the intra-author consistency property which is one of two components in our definition of writing style. The main intuition of this paper is that we can define a general stylometric space from a set of reference authors such that, in this space, the coordinates of different documents will be close when the documents are by the same author, and spread away when they are by different authors, even for documents by authors who are not in the set of reference authors. The method we propose allows for the clustering of documents based on stylistic clues reflecting the authorship of documents. For the empirical validation of the method, we train a deep neural network model to predict authors of a large reference dataset consisting of news and blog articles. Albeit the learning process is supervised, it does not require a dedicated labeling of the data but it relies only on the metadata of the articles which are available in huge amounts. We evaluate the model on multiple datasets, on both the authorship clustering and the authorship attribution tasks.},

  abstract = {The number of opinions in news media platforms is increasing dramatically with daily news hits, and people spending more and more time to discuss topics and share experiences. Such user generated content represents a promising source for improving the effectiveness of news articles recommendation and retrieval. However, the corpus of opinions is often large and noisy making it hard to find prominent content. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a novel scoring model that ranks opinions based on their relevance and prominence. We define the prominence of an opinion using its relationships with other opinions. To this end, we (1) create a directed graph of opinions where each link represents the sentiment an opinion expresses about another opinion (2) propose a new variation of the PageRank algorithm that boosts the scores of opinions along links with positive sentiments and decreases them along links with negative sentiments. We have tested the effectiveness of our model through extensive experiments using three datasets crawled from CNN, Independent, and The Telegraph Web sites . The experiments show that our scoring model achieves high quality results.},

Users of such platforms discuss around topics providing new insights and sometimes revealing hidden aspects about topics. The valuable information provided by users needs to be exploited to improve the accuracy of news recommendation and thus keep users always motivated to provide comments. However, exploiting user generated content is very challenging due its noisy nature. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel news recommendation system that (1) enrich the profile of news article with user generated content, (2) deal with noisy contents by proposing a ranking model for users' comments, and (3) propose a diversification model for comments to remove redundancies and provide a wide coverage of topic aspects. The results show that our approach outperforms baseline approaches achieving high accuracy.},

  abstract = {In online learning platforms such as MOOCs, computerized assessment needs to be optimized in order to prevent boredom and dropout of learners. Indeed, they should spend as little time as possible in tests and still receive valuable feedback. It is actually possible to reduce the number of questions for the same accuracy with computerized adaptive testing (CAT): asking the next question according to the past performance of the examinee. CAT algorithms are divided in two categories: summative CATs, that measure the level of examinees, and formative CATs, that provide feedback to the examinees at the end of the test by specifying which knowledge components need further work. In this paper, we formalize the problem of test-size reduction by predicting student performance, and propose a new hybrid CAT algorithm GenMA based on the general diagnostic model, that is both summative and formative. Using real datasets, we compare our model to popular CAT models and show that GenMA achieves better accuracy while using fewer questions than the existing models.},

  abstract = {Computerized adaptive testing (CAT) is a mode of testing which has gained increasing popularity over the past years. It selects the next question to ask to the examinee in order to evaluate her level efficiently, by using her answers to the previous questions. Traditionally, CAT systems have been relying on item response theory (IRT) in order to provide an effective measure of latent abilities in possibly large-scale assessments. More recently, from the perspective of providing useful feedback to examinees, other models have been studied for cognitive diagnosis. One of them is the q-matrix model, which draws a link between questions and examinee knowledge components. In this paper, we define a protocol based on performance prediction to evaluate adaptive testing algorithms. We use it to evaluate q-matrices in the context of assessments and compare their behavior to item response theory. Results computed on three real datasets of growing size and of various nature suggest that tests of different type need different models.},

We address this design problem in the setting of the GLAM platform only made up of generic components. We present a rule-based approach helping an AH creator in reusing its user and domain models to create a specific adaptive hypermedia. This semi-automatic approach takes the creator's models as specialisations of GLAM generic models and requires the creator to express a minimum set of mappings between his models and the generic ones. The process results in a merged model consisting of the generic and the corresponding specific model. This merged model can be used by the adaptation model.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, several efforts are focused on re-using generic platforms to create new systems, in order to make the design process easier and faster. Often, the designer has his own models and resources and would like to reuse the generic system over his resources. That means, he has to integrate his models and resources in the system, and then to directly reuse the generic system. But many problems occur. One of them is that the designer needs to translate his models into the specific format that understood by the system and to use the vocabulary specific to that system. Furthermore, he also needs to translate all the instantiations of his models (i.e. the resources and their metadata). We think that this task is tedious and time-consuming and we want to avoid it. Our objective is to allow the designer to reuse his models (his vocabulary) and his models' instantiations without any change of format or vocabulary. For example, a generic Adaptive Hypermedia System (AHS) is made of a generic adaptation model relying on generic user and domain models. The designer would like to integrate his models and instances in the generic models in order to reuse the generic adaptation engine. Specific systems can be obtained by specializing the generic models. However, this specialization process is not always easy to perform. It has to be supported to make the design process easier and faster. This paper focuses on assisting designers to specialize generic models using their own models. We aim to automate this process which has been so far entirely manual. Our objectives are twofold: to create a support for defining mappings between elements in generic models and elements in the designer's personal models and to help creating consistent and relevant models integrating the generic and specific ones and taking into account the mappings between them. The proposed approach relies on OWL1, a W3C standard and SWRL2, a W3C proposal.},
