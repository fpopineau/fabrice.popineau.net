  abstract = {Adaptive spacing algorithms are powerful tools for helping learners manage their study time efficiently. By personalizing the temporal distribution of retrieval practice of a given piece of knowledge, they improve learners' long-term memory retention compared to fixed review schedules. However, such algorithms are generally designed for the pure memorization of single items, such as vocabulary words. Yet, the spacing effect has been shown to extend to more complex knowledge, such as the practice of mathematical skills. In this article, we extend three adaptive spacing heuristics from the literature for selecting the best skill to review at any timestamp given a student's past study history. In real-world educational settings, items generally involve multiple skills at the same time. Thus, we also propose a multi-skill version for two of these heuristics: instead of selecting one single skill, they select with a greedy procedure the most promising subset of skills to review. To compare these five heuristics, we develop a synthetic experimental framework that simulates student learning and forgetting trajectories with a student model. We run multiple synthetic experiments on large cohorts of 500 simulated students and publicly release the code for these experiments. Our results highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each heuristic in terms of performance, robustness, and complexity. Finally, we find evidence that selecting the best subset of skills yields better retention compared to selecting the single best skill to review.},

  abstract = {News media platforms publish articles about daily events letting their users comment on them, and forming interesting discussions in almost real-time. To keep users always active and interested, media platforms need an effective recommender system to bring up new articles that match user interests. In this article, we show that we can improve the quality of recommendation by exploiting valuable information provided by user comments. This information reveals aspects not directly tackled by the news article on which they have been posted. We call such aspects latent aspects. We demonstrate how these latent aspects can make a crucial difference in the accuracy of future recommendation. The challenge in detecting them is due to the noisy nature of user comments. To support our claim, we propose a novel news recommendation system that (1) enriches the description of news articles by latent aspects extracted from user comments, (2) deals with noisy comments by proposing a model for user comments ranking, and (3) proposes a diversification model to remove redundancies and provide a wide coverage of aspects. We have tested our approach using large collections of real user activities in four news Web sites, namely The INDEPENDENT, The Telegraph, CNN and Al-Jazeera. The results show that our approach outperforms baseline approaches achieving a significantly higher accuracy.},
